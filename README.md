# EcologicalModels
Classic ecological models. Based on *An Illustrated Guide to Theoritical Ecology* from Ted J. Case

# Introduction
This Summer (2022), I started reading the book "An Illustrated Guide to Theoritical Ecology" from Ted J. Case. To better grasp the classic ecological models,and explore their behaviours, I decided to code some of them. My objective is to eventually create a *Shiny* application where I and others can play around with the parameters of the different models and vizualize how they behave.
